While these plugins are intended to be useful for site administrators to add features to their theme, it is assumed that those using them will have some basic knowledge of theme structures in order to put the 'require/include' statements in correctly, or to adapt the guides according to the different structures some themes have.

While they can be used in theme development, it is generally assumed that a theme designer releasing a theme to the community would build the code directly into their theme - e.g. using recognised ways to add style sheets and therefore images within those style sheets. Although, given the modular nature of MOODLE, there is no requirement to do so. Please bear in mind that the splitting of the language file into the separate plugin areas may have undesirable effects on translations, which may then need to be added manually.

This theme has been built using the plugins directly as a demonstration for those who need to use them in that way and not necessarily as a guide to good theme development practice for those releasing/creating themes for outside their own institution.
