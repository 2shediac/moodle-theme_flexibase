First of all copy the /plugins/awesombar folder into your theme and
find/replace all instances of 'flexibase' with your theme name
e.g. (for linux users)
grep -rl "flexibase" /var/www/html/moodle/theme/yourthemename/plugins/awesomebar  | xargs sed -i 's|flexibase|yourthemename|g'

If you want to keep most of the files within the plugins folder you can
add includes that point to them using the guides below. Alternatively you
could copy and paste the content of each file into the relevant main file,
or move it into the relevant folder - depending on how your theme is
organised. However, some of the code is adjusted to make sure it works
directly within this plugins folder and would need to be ammended if the
files are moved out to their 'traditional' locations - e.g. images in the
css are served directly from the awesomebarpix folder rather than using
the [[pix:theme|filename]] format.

awesomebarpreheaderinc.php
Immeditately prior to the doctype statement in your layout file
    require('path/to/awesomebarpreheaderinc.php');
    
awesomebarinc.php
In the layout files, positioned where you want the awesomebar - usually
immediately prior to the main navbar
    require('path/to/awesomebarinc.php');

awesomebarlang_en.php
In your language file
    require('path/to/awesomebarlang_en.php');

topsettings_renderer.php
In your renderers.php file
    require_once('path/to/topsettings_renderer.php');

awesomelib.php
In your lib.php file
    require('path/to/awesomelib.php');

awesomebar_settings.php
In your settings.php file
    require('path/to/awesomebar_settings.php');

awesomebar.css - Add the following line into your <head> section of your
layout pages.
      <link href='path/to/awesomebar.css' rel="stylesheet">

path/to = $CFG->dirroot/theme/yourthemename/plugins/awesomebar
eg.
    require($CFG->dirroot .'/theme/flexibase/plugins/awesomebar/awesomebarpreheaderinc.php');
    <link href="<?php echo $CFG->wwwroot.'/theme/flexibase/plugins/awesomebar/awesomebar.css';?>" rel="stylesheet">
    require($CFG->dirroot .'/theme/flexibase/plugins/awesomebar/awesomebarinc.php');
    require($CFG->dirroot .'/theme/flexibase/plugins/awesomebar/awesomebarlang_en.php');
    require_once($CFG->dirroot .'/theme/flexibase/plugins/awesomebar/topsettings_renderer.php');
    require($CFG->dirroot .'/theme/flexibase/plugins/awesomebar/awesomelib.php');
    require($CFG->dirroot .'/theme/flexibase/plugins/awesomebar/awesomebar_settings.php');
OR
    require($CFG->dirroot .'/theme/flexibase/plugins/awesomebar/awesomebar_settings_alternate.php');


REMEMBER: Purge All Caches when complete - theme designer mode does not
clear language caches.

***TESTED BY ADDING INTO BCU theme***
***TESTED BY ADDING INTO CLEAN THEME***
IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. Clean (and some other themes) theme only has a single settings page and so requires the awesomebar_settings_alternate.php file for its settings and not the one used in flexibase.
2. Some css alteration is required when using awesomebar as by default in Clean (and other themes) it is present but behind the top navbar - as this varies from theme to theme it is not part of the plugin, but in most cases adding a top margin to body will remove any display issues like this.
